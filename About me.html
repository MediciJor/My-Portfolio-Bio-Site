    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Christopher Gerard Lao, <br>
        I am a Medical Biology student that wants to change into another field, specifically IT. <br><br>
        
                You might be asking why I switched to an entirely different field, 
        because I do not feel like I am suited for the intense pressure of 
        the medical field, which is why I left the medical field before I  
        start to waver my dedication to helping people medically. I have  
        been having difficulties in studying and with the lack of support 
        from anyone in the world nowadays it is hard to continue studying 
        at all unless you have incredibly high dedication and motivation. 
        The environment for studying is incredibly toxic, that a student  
        who also has a hard time may just be left behind. Furthermore, the
        way of education is incredibly outdated, and the way of teaching  
        has not changed for the better, it might even have changed for the
        worse.<br><br>
