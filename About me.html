<h3> About Me</h3>

<p> My name is Christopher Gerard Lao,
I am a Medical Biology student that wants to change into another field, specifically IT.
<br><br>

You might be asking why I switched to an entirely different field, because I do not feel 
like I am suited for the intense pressure of the medical field, which is why 
I left the medical field before I start to waver my dedication to helping 
people medically. I have been having difficulties in studying and with the 
lack of support from anyone in the world nowadays it is hard to continue 
studying at all unless you have incredibly high dedication and motivation. 
The environment for studying is incredibly toxic, that a student who also 
has a hard time may just be left behind. Furthermore, the way of education 
is incredibly outdated, and the way of teaching has not changed for the 
better, it might even have changed for the worse.
