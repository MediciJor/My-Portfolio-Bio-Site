<h2>Welcome to My Page <br>
     What's this for?</h2>
    <p>This simple HTML document was made to compile the things I have made, <br>
    It might not be the best, but I'm still working on it</p>

<section id="BasicInfo">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Christopher Gerard Lao, <br>
        I am a Medical Biology student that wants to change into another field, specifically IT. <br><br>
        
                You might be asking why I switched to an entirely different field, 
        because I do not feel like I am suited for the intense pressure of 
        the medical field, which is why I left the medical field before I  
        start to waver my dedication to helping people medically. I have  
        been having difficulties in studying and with the lack of support 
        from anyone in the world nowadays it is hard to continue studying 
        at all unless you have incredibly high dedication and motivation. 
        The environment for studying is incredibly toxic, that a student  
        who also has a hard time may just be left behind. Furthermore, the
        way of education is incredibly outdated, and the way of teaching  
        has not changed for the better, it might even have changed for the
        worse.<br><br>

<section id="Goals">
        <h2>GOALS</h2>
    <p>
                Which is why I wanted to create a way for anyone to learn and not 
        just to study. Something that can make learning visible to ones one
        progress, so that people dont give up immediately because they dont
        see any progress. I wanted to create a system to see people's progress
        as well as a way to personalize the learning experience, this way we 
        can fully utilize the strengths of each individual and help them. <br><br>
                But why IT then, why not go to an education field? Because I believe 
        I am able to learn how to help people by myself, but I am not able to 
        learn how to create a system to help people by myself. I will need the
        help of mentors who are willing to support me despite the dryness of 
        empathy in not only my university bu also in the world.
